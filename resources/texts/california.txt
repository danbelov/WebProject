A California roll or California maki is a makizushi sushi roll,
usually made inside-out, containing cucumber, crab meat or imitation crab,
and avocado. Sometimes crab salad is substituted for the crab stick,
and often the outer layer of rice in an inside-out roll (uramaki)
is sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds, tobiko or masago (capelin roe).

As one of the most popular styles of sushi in Canada and the United States,
the California roll has been influential in sushi's global popularity and
in inspiring sushi chefs around the world in creating their non-traditional fusion cuisine.
