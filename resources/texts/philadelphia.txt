<h1>Philadelphia roll</h1>
<h2>
A Philadelphia roll is a makizushi (also classified as a kawarizushi)[1] type of sushi generally
made with smoked salmon, cream cheese, and cucumber. It can also include
other ingredients, such as avocado, onion, and sesame seed.
</h2>
<h3>
The name "Philly roll" derives from the Philadelphia Cream Cheese brand.
Incorporating lox and cream cheese in a sushi roll took this popular combination of
ingredients from its use on a bagel when sushi increased in popularity in North America from the 1980s.
Variations on traditional rolls like the Philly roll have been criticized for taking what was traditionally a healthy,
low-fat food in its Japanese iteration (in which salmon would be raw and cream cheese nonexistent) and making
it into a high-fat one. Traditional rolls does not contain dairy products.
